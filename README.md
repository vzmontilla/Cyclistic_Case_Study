# Cyclistic Case Study!

This is a case study for one of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone projects. I'm on a journey to improve and learn as much as I can so any feedback is greatly appreciated!

## Background

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo-tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago.

Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## The Data Source

User data from the past 12 months, January 2022 - December 2022 has been made available. Each data set is in csv format and details every ride logged by Cyclistic customers. However, please keep the [Data License Agreement](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) in mind when dealing with any of this data, or data related to this project. This are the dataset of cyclistic that i used [Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

## The Process

What i did is i import the csv files in power query where I will be able to further inspect, and manipulate, the data to allow myself to analyze it properly.I simply created a database for the CaseStudy using the excel power query creating tables and queryinh the data. After I done,  I used R to merge all the dataset into one file.

Once all of the data has been merge i can start creating data visualization in Tableau.

## The Visual

This part is where I create the visualization of my Case study.

All of the finalized visuals are available on my [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/CyclisticTripDate/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
